# Handbook of Programming Languages

Milestone 3 – Project Design & Setup (Assignment 3)

Team: LangHandbookKZ  
Members: Almukhammed, Adil, Arman  
Group: SE-2411 

This is our planning stage for the final project — "Handbook of Programming Languages"

### What is the project?
Simple web application where students can:
- Search programming languages (Python, Go, Java, C++ etc.)
- See description, year created, popularity, code examples
- See categories (web, mobile, systems, AI, data science and more)
- Bonus: view statistics (how many people looked at each language)

### Current status (Milestone 3)
- This is just planning — no full code yet.
- We have skeleton (go.mod + main.go) so `go run .` works.
- All documents (Proposal, Architecture, Gantt plan) are in this ZIP.

### My part (Almukhammedd)
- Wrote Project Proposal
- Created Git repository
- Made initial commits and feature/almukhammed branch

### How to run skeleton
```bash
cd handbook
go run .
