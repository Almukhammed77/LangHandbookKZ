## What is the project?

A simple web application where students can:

- Search programming languages (Python, Go, Java, C++ etc.)
- View language details: description, year created, popularity, code examples
- Browse categories (web, mobile, systems, AI, data science, etc.)
- **Bonus:** view statistics (how many times each language was viewed)

## Current status (Milestone 3)

- This is a **planning milestone**, not full implementation
- Project structure (Go skeleton) is prepared
